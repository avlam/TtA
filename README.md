# TtA - Through the Ages
Log and Explore playstyles and strategies of Through the Ages

On March 28, 2020, 4 friends played their first game of Through the Ages together. Since learning the game, 54 (and counting) games have been played via the website boardgaming-online.com. This project is an exploration of the games played, and an analysis of the performance of each player.
